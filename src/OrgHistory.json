      "description": "Amkeni Malindi began in 2009 as a small support group dedicated to creating a safe space for men who have sex with men in Malindi, Kilifi County. What started as a community gathering soon blossomed into a powerful movement with a mission to advocate for the rights and health of LGBT individuals in the region. In 2010, a partnership with KEMRI enabled Amkeni to offer a secure environment for community meetings, expanding our reach and deepening our commitment to providing comprehensive services. Through peer education, we began actively championing human rights and addressing critical issues affecting the LGBT community across Kilifi County. Over the years, our network of partnerships has grown, enabling us to offer even greater support and resources. Collaborations with the Kenya Red Cross led to the establishment of our Drop-In Center for Education (DICE) while our strategic alliance with UHAI developed a roadmap for progress outlined in our 2018-2020 strategic plan. Today, our partnerships span national organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK), and intersectional HIV programs with the National AIDS Control Council (NACC) and National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP). With a dedicated office in Kilifi, Amkeni operates as a cornerstone of advocacy and support for Kenyaâ€™s coastal strip, delivering impact through research, partnerships, and a strong governance structure led by a diverse board. Guided by values of integrity and inclusivity, Amkeni remains resilient in the face of changing policies, donor dynamics, and stakeholder needs. As we continue to evolve, our commitment is clear: to offer ethical, impactful services that enhance the lives of our community members and contribute to a fairer, healthier society."
